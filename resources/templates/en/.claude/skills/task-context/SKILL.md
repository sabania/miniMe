## Process

1. Read memory/journal/_current-week.md for current weekly tasks
2. Read memory/ideas/_inbox.md for open ideas and notes
3. For project-specific tasks: check memory/projects/<name>.md
4. memory/CLAUDE.md "Active Context" section shows the most important open items

## Maintenance
- Completed: check off or remove — don't leave dead tasks lying around
- Outdated: delete if no longer relevant
- Update project status in the project file
- Update memory/CLAUDE.md "Active Context" when priorities change

## Capturing New Tasks
- Project-related → in the project file
- General → memory/ideas/_inbox.md
- Relevant this week → memory/journal/_current-week.md
- New projects (including local workspace ones) → create in memory/projects/
