## Process

1. Determine which project is relevant (from conversation or CWD)
2. Read memory/projects/CLAUDE.md for project overview
3. Read memory/projects/<projectname>.md for details
4. Check if the project has its own CLAUDE.md (projects/<name>/CLAUDE.md)

## What's in Project Files?
- Current status and next steps
- Architecture decisions
- Known problems and workarounds
- Tech stack and conventions
- Involved people (reference to people/)
- Open TODOs
- Budget/timeline if relevant

## Project Types
Not just dev projects! Also:
- Construction, renovation
- Travel planning
- Administrative projects (taxes, insurance)
- Personal projects (hobbies, events)
